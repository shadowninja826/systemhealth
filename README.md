# systemhealth
Checks general system health of mining rig

This C program collects and displays real-time system information, including CPU temperatures, disk usage, memory utilization, top CPU-consuming processes, and recent XMRig log entries. It reads hardware sensor data directly from /sys/class/hwmon, parses system statistics from /proc, and provides a simple command-line dashboard for monitoring Linux performance—ideal for mining rigs, servers, or general system diagnostics.
